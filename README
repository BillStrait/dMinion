This is a snapshot of an 'in development' build of dMinion, my android
app. Quite a bit of this code has changed since the most recent release
which is $.99 on the Android app store.

This git may be useful for folks who want to make their own initative
tracker, or people with other ideas for 4th edition Dungeons and Dragons,
since the 'character' class has most of the important variables generated.

as long as you're not selling it, impersonating me, or blaming me when
something goes wrong.
